# Efficient Gaussian Process on Graphs

This repository hosts an ongoing research project, developed as part of my fourth-year research for the Cambridge Engineering degree.

## Project Overview

The project aims to harness the General Graph Random Features (g-GRF) algorithm to enable efficient computation of covariance matrices on graphs. By doing so, it makes Gaussian Process (GP) inference computationally efficient and scalable for graph-structured data.

## Repository Structure

- **`experiments/`**: Includes Jupyter notebooks demonstrating use cases and experiments with the implemented methods.
- **`efficient_graph_gp/`**: Core module implementing the graph GP inference system and the g-GRF algorithm.
- **`presentations/`**: My presentation on project motivation and explain the GRF algorithm.

## Research Objectives

1. Develop scalable Gaussian Process inference methods tailored for graph data.
2. Implement and optimize the g-GRF algorithm to efficiently compute covariance matrices for graphs.
3. Demonstrate practical applications of GP inference on graph-structured datasets.
